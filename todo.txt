- after getting adjacency matrix, get all four edge subsets and remove them from the matrix
    - check to see which ones disconnect the graph
- flyping code, obviously
- recursive function termination condition will come from getting Jason's code to work with mine


Compiling Tip:
    i) first, compile utilities to an object file "gcc -c src/utilities.c src/queue.c"
    ii) then, compile main with the utilities.o file, making sure to link to the right libraries
        "gcc utilities.o queue.o main.c -lm -lplCurve" optionally adding "-o exec_name" for an executable with name "exec_name"
